# Chatty Group Project


## Assignment

#### The "chatty" assignment is an in class, group project that is designed to help us expand our knowledge and experience working collaboratively. This main focus of the assignment is to review the information from our last two milestones, The-Static-Web” and the current “Single-Page-Apps” and combine that knowledge into a working web chatroom. 


## Criteria

##### Navigation bar

1. Create an element to serve as the navigation bar for your application.
1. Create an element to hold the logo for your application. It can be as simple as text, but if you want to find an image, that's fine.
1. Create a input field for a user to enter in a message.
1. Add an event listener for "keypress" and detect when then return key has been pressed in the message field.
1. When return key is detected, you'll create a new message (*see details below*).
1. Create a button to clear all messages.
1. When the user clicks the clear messages button, all current chat messages should be removed from the application.
1. If there are no messages, then the clear messages button should be disabled (*see example above*).
1. The navigation bar should remain at the top of the screen, even if the contents of the page start to scroll.
